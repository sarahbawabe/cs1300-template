    <h1>Could the experience of doing laundry benefit from better design? </h1>
    <div><img src= "./laundry.jpg"/></div>
    
    <p1> 
      <div> For this project, I investigated user interaction with a common household interface: a washing machine.</div>  
    </p1>
    <div class= "container1">
      <div><img src= "./laundry.png"/></div>
      <p2>The washing machine is a home appliance used to wash laundry. To operate the machine, the user adds detergent, loads the clothes into the machine, sets the wash settings, and starts the machine. At the end of the wash cycle, the clothes are collected and transferred to the dryer, or hung to air dry. </p2>
    </div>
  </div>
    <p3>
      To get firsthand input, I interviewed 3 users who I observed using the washing machine.
    I asked the following questions:  </p3>
    
      <p5>
        <div>   1. From a scale of 1-10 (1 being the least and 10 being the most), rate your level of familiarity with using this machine. </div> 
        <div>   2. From a scale of 1-10 (1 being the least and 10 being the most), rate the efficiency of your interaction with the machine. </div> 
        <div>   3. Tell me about the thoughts that went through your mind during this experience. </div> 
        <div>   4. Were there any moments of confusion or hesitation during your experience? If so, please elaborate. </div> 
        <div>   5. What is your favorite and least favorite quality of this experience? </div> 
        <div>   6. If it were possible, is there anything you would like to change about this experience? </div> 
      </p5>

      <p3>
      From the interview responses, I was able to construct some key insights about the users' interactions with washing machine.
      </p3>
      <div class= "container2">
        <div><img src= "./user1.png"/></div> 

        <p4>User 1 was a long-time user of the interface, and rated their familiarity with the experience, as well as the efficiency of the interaction, as very high. This process was almost like second nature to them; thus, not much active thought went towards the interaction with the interface. User 1 particularly appreciated the convenience of the machine, as well as their ease of interaction due to familiarity; their least favorite part of the experience was the hassle of collecting the clothes into the hamper, and transporting the hamper down to the basement (the location of the machine). </p4> 
      </div>
      
      <div class= "container2">
        <div><img src= "./user2.png"/></div> 

        <p4>User 2 rated their familiarity with the experience as moderate , and the efficiency of the interaction with the machine as moderately high. They remarked on being forgetful about collecting their laundry from the machine, and were worried that their clothes would be taken out of the washing machine (by other tenants in the building) before they remembered to collect them. User 2 enjoyed the convenience of the location of the machine, but disliked the time-consuming ritual of doing laundry, and having to walk downstairs multiple times to check if the machines were still occupied on particularly busy days. </p4> 
        </div>
      
      <div class= "container2">
        <div><img src= "./user3.png"/></div> 
  
        <p4>User 3 rated their familiarity with the interface as low, remarking that they had previously utilized laundry service. They rated the efficiency of the interaction as moderate, but noted that the process was more time consuming due to their low level of familiarity with the process. Their least favorite part of the experience was the ambiguity of the different labels on the machine; User 3 suggested that they could be more straightforward and beginner-friendly. One thing that they would change about the experience is the detergent cartridge; since the detergent is dispersed into the machine as the cartridge is filled, there is no way to determine how much total detergent is added without using an external measuring cup.</p4>

      The responses led to 2 personas represented by empathy maps showing Productive Pat and Forgetful Francine.
